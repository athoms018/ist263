        <h1>Adam Thomsons Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        My name is Adam Thomson and I am a current senior at Syracuse University studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism in Newhouse. After college I want to move to Los Angeles and work in movies and television. Over the past six months I have had three different internships in the entertainment space. Originally I am from Cazenovia, NY which is about 25 minutes away from campus. Outside of classes I love watching TV shows like the Sopranos and Better Call Saul and I love listening to rock and roll music.
