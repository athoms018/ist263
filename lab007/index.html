        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
       <p>
        My name is Adam Thomson and I am a current senior at <strong>Syracuse University</strong> studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism in Newhouse. 
        </p>
        <p>
        After college I want to move to Los Angeles and work in movies and television. Over the past six months I have had three different internships in the entertainment space. Originally I am from Cazenovia, NY which is about 25 minutes away from campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of classes I love watching TV shows like the Sopranos and Better Call Saul and I love listening to rock and roll music.
